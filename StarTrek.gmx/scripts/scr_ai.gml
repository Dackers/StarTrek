/* Possible Future Enemy States
Amush - enemy will hide behind a solid object until the player is close. Then open fire.
Cautious - enemy will attack in open but if player gets to close he will take cover
Grenade - Same as cautious but the enemy has a chance to toss a grenade at the player
Ruthless - the enemy will charge the player and will not take cover
Search and destroy - Like cautious again, but instead of waiting for the player to find him, he will search for the player
optimist - if his health gets too low he will run and take cover
suppressing - if the player takes cover, then he will come out of cover and spray bullets at the players last out-of-cover position for a few seconds
cowardly - takes a couple of shots, then just runs away really fast, dodging bullets as he goes. if he gets to a hiding place for a few seconds, he may consider reappearing to fire at the player a bit more.
Fleeing - Only happens when fear is very high. The enemy will want nothing to do with the player and will run the other way. This can be prevented if the player injures the enemy (low health)
Defensive - When fear is moderate-high. Tries to stay in cover for as long as possible and will only attack when it sees the player.
Grouping - When fear is at least at a medium level and other enemies are nearby. Tries to stay near other enemies.
Suicide Run - When health is extremely low and fear is at any level, the enemy will run at the player swinging its weapon around in attempt to hit the player
Suicide Bomber - Enemy at player with grenades held. Only happens when the enemy is a certain range. Tries to kill itself in proximity of the player. When killed, it drops the grenade
Barrier Fire - When fear is low-moderate. The enemy will pop out from cover for about 5 seconds, shoots, then pops back into cover
